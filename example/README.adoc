== Introduction ==

It is a simple example to show generation of HTML documentation using link:https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-lein-plugin[lein-asciidoctor].


== Configuration options ==

Options are already configured, you check them in `project.clj` file:
[source,clojure]
.project.clj
----
:asciidoctor {:sources "README.adoc"
              :to-dir "generated"
              :extract-css true
              :source-highlight true
              :toc :left}
----

You could play with options later to see different results.


== Usage ==

Run the following command in the current directory (`"example"`):

[source,bash]
.Console
----
lein asciidoc
----

It shouldn't take too much time.


== Results ==

In case of successful completion, you should see the following message in console:

[source,bash]
.Console
----
Processed asciidoc file: ./README.adoc
----

New `"generated"` directory with 3 files should be created:

* ./generated/README.html
* ./generated/asciidoctor.css
* ./generated/coderay-asciidoctor.css
